Extremely disappointed.We usually go 2 Towne Lake location but were STARVING! Big mistake coming here. They should have offered 2 replace it when they realized they left it in to long but guess they decided 2 see if we would complain. Yup, I'll complain- where it does the most good...publicly.

Pizzas were the size of small tortillas and when I asked about that was told they are just thick/-um, no. See pic. We' were overcharged and they gave my husband's pizza to another customer (which we didn't discover until the wait had been quite long). We got the $ back for that (and corrected the overcharge) and he did not end up eating.  No offer to comp a pizza &amp; remake.  Outdoor seating was filthy and had clearly not been cleaned since yesterday at best.

      <td>MOD Pizza has become my go to pizza spot every week. You cannot top the idea of customizing your pizza for a standard cost. I usually go with the mod size Which is an 11 inch size pizza with cauliflower crust. I top it off with a lot of cheese and a lot of vegetables, specifically garlic mushrooms and jalapeños. They have a menu with preselected types of pizza But I find customizing my pizza more rewarding. As you can tell from the pictures, the toppings are pretty stacked.Mod pizza also has a reward program where 150 points will give you a free pizza, and you are earn one point by spending one dollar.</td>

Once we placed our order she stared whispering to her coworkers and we could tell she was talking about us. Another co-worker was having sidebar with her about empty all the trashes and taking them directly to the dumpster. I'm only writing this review because this is the second time I've had bad service here. I would also like to note that every ingredient was packed on. Even when I asked for light jalapeños. I literally got about 15 jalapeños on a mini. Waste of produce. Needs customer service training and quality control. Never coming back to this location again.</td>

Stood for over 5 minutes trying to get the finishing glaze on the pizza I ordered to watch a guy sneeze all on the pizzas in the oven and then grab more food without washing his hands. Absolutely disgusting. I won't be back</td>

      <td>I love this place because it's affordable and has unlimited toppings all for one price! you can switch it up and even do half and half if you like with no extra charges! The pizza is super good and I like that it is thin crust. 10/10 recommend!</td>

      <td>Great place to eat pizza and customize your own there! Now w/ the pandemic going on the employees the take safety measures very serious and made changes on silverware and asking for parmesan and red pepper by having to ask for any of these items instead of having those displayed by the drink station.Food wise is good although you can get full pretty easily from getting a MOD size pizza and a drink. Also something fun about their drink station is that you can actually make your own drinks too by mixing two together! I tried making an Arnold Palmer by mixing their sweet tea and lemonade together and it turned out to be one of the best Arnold Palmers I made there! Hopefully I can come back here to eat more pizza eventually! :)</td>

This was a Tuesday evening before the dinner rush.    Out of 15(est.) tables, All were sitting empty and dirty.   The frozen pizza from the grocery store is better priced and better tasting.   The salad was wilted and obviously had been sitting out all day.We ordered 2 mini pepperoni pizzas, 2 drinks and an order of breadsticks.
