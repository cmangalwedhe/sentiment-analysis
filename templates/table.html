      <td>BURNT!! Just spent $30 on 2 cauliflower pizzas. For $3.30 MORE for each one u 2 can enjoy (NOT) an extra crispy, extra crunchy, "fall on the floor when you bite it" charred pizza. Extremely disappointed.We usually go 2 Towne Lake location but were STARVING! Big mistake coming here. They should have offered 2 replace it when they realized they left it in to long but guess they decided 2 see if we would complain. Yup, I'll complain- where it does the most good...publicly. Not coming to this location anymore. remember, u have Crust Pizza opening ard the area</td>

      <td>Avoid this location. Last time we visited shortly after open (about 11:15a), staff had us stand there for 15-20 min while they worked on online orders. We were the only people in line.. food was okay. Yesterday, we also arrived early, very few In restaurant, were helped promptly but--wow, the food prep was awful. Pizzas were the size of small tortillas and when I asked about that was told they are just thick/-um, no. See pic. We' were overcharged and they gave my husband's pizza to another customer (which we didn't discover until the wait had been quite long). We got the $ back for that (and corrected the overcharge) and he did not end up eating.  No offer to comp a pizza &amp; remake.  Outdoor seating was filthy and had clearly not been cleaned since yesterday at best. Retrain &amp; do some quality control here Mod. Everyone else avoid until it improves.</td>

      <td>MOD Pizza has become my go to pizza spot every week. You cannot top the idea of customizing your pizza for a standard cost. I usually go with the mod size Which is an 11 inch size pizza with cauliflower crust. I top it off with a lot of cheese and a lot of vegetables, specifically garlic mushrooms and jalapeños. They have a menu with preselected types of pizza But I find customizing my pizza more rewarding. As you can tell from the pictures, the toppings are pretty stacked.Mod pizza also has a reward program where 150 points will give you a free pizza, and you are earn one point by spending one dollar.</td>

      <td>Horrible customer service. Very slow. When we walked in we were not greeted. Someone finally walked up and said, "what would you like". She kept acting as if she couldn't hear us. Once we placed our order she stared whispering to her coworkers and we could tell she was talking about us. Another co-worker was having sidebar with her about empty all the trashes and taking them directly to the dumpster. I'm only writing this review because this is the second time I've had bad service here. I would also like to note that every ingredient was packed on. Even when I asked for light jalapeños. I literally got about 15 jalapeños on a mini. Waste of produce. Needs customer service training and quality control. Never coming back to this location again.</td>

      <td>Great place to eat pizza and customize your own there! Now w/ the pandemic going on the employees the take safety measures very serious and made changes on silverware and asking for parmesan and red pepper by having to ask for any of these items instead of having those displayed by the drink station.Food wise is good although you can get full pretty easily from getting a MOD size pizza and a drink. Also something fun about their drink station is that you can actually make your own drinks too by mixing two together! I tried making an Arnold Palmer by mixing their sweet tea and lemonade together and it turned out to be one of the best Arnold Palmers I made there! Hopefully I can come back here to eat more pizza eventually! :)</td>

Dirty is being too nice.  I had to ask someone to clean a table for us.  He literally wiped everything on to the floor. This was a Tuesday evening before the dinner rush.    Out of 15(est.) tables, All were sitting empty and dirty.   The frozen pizza from the grocery store is better priced and better tasting.   The salad was wilted and obviously had been sitting out all day.We ordered 2 mini pepperoni pizzas, 2 drinks and an order of breadsticks.

      <td>So the manager on shift at this time today (didn't get her name but I should have), along with the staff were extremely accommodating. This is also one of the nicest MOD establishments i've been into very clean and very efficient. The pizza was great and the staff was very friendly. Short story: waiting in line for pizza I was acting like a buffoon and my girlfriend got embarrassed for me for what I was doing and I thought I had ruined her day. Shortly after we sit down after we pay they call her name and already in fear that I ruined her evening she comes back with a cheese-less pizza so I point it out and she was so enveloped in her own feelings she didn't even notice. Feeling like I had to do at least one thing right I went and took the pizza back to the line and placed it in front of the line staff and asked them what this was. The gentleman at the cash register at the time was shocked and politely told me he'd remake it for free. He was very patient with me while I was visibly distressed (more so about my own mistakes than anything) and later on after the new pizza came out I went to ask for more ranch and pesto and the manager handed me two free pizza vouchers for her mistake which she apologized for. To all the staff at this location, you are all amazing at your jobs and it was simply one mistake. Again, I was more stressed about my own shortcomings as a good boyfriend in that moment and I wanna thank y'all for being polite and patient with me in that brief moment. Thank you all.</td>

Me and my family were sitting in the corner near the Pac-Man arcade machines and we clearly heard her screaming. She was a smaller individual with many colors in her hair. She had said she was the manager, but later on, she was screaming at a different customer about how she didn't say something. I couldn't hear what the customer said, but the manager had laughed at the customer and then said "I didn't laugh" being an obvious liar, so who knows if she was actually a manager. If she isn't, he manager should be spoken to, but if she is a manager, then I feel bad for her staff. Again, we were behind the wall, and still heard her screaming at customer.</td>

It is very similar to Subway as you tell them what you want on your pizza and watch them put it together. I have ordered online to pick up and both times they have been ready when promised. There is plenty of seating and parking. The first time I picked up I wasn't greeted even though I stood next to the register for awhile. I realized I needed to pick up at another place so I walked over and after a little longer standing there and not being greeted I finally was and got my pizza. The second trip was much better and the guy taking the pizzas out of the oven was very nice and offered me a drink while I waited (I was early). He apologized for the wait and called me right away when it came out of the oven.</td>

I've been back many times and have had pleasant service, good pizza and you meet the nicest people.Service goes very quickly. When my Grandkids came for a visit they were blown away. They loved ordering individual pizzas and loved the fresh taste.The reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is I think they need to chop some of the ingredients smaller to make it easier to eat such as onions and mushrooms. With it being that size when you bite into it that whole piece comes with the bite. It farther have onion, mushroom or whatever on most of my bites.But love the pizza.</td>

Me and my mom went in for a pizza and a salad to-go. They weren't very busy and we were the only people in line when we got there. The girl who made our order was very nice, but did move a little slow. A couple walked in minutes behind us and their pizzas were in the oven before mine. I went and got my drink as my mom paid. She said she saw the girl move my pizza to the oven. My mom got her salad and went ahead and ate it while we waited for my pizza. During this time the girl who made our order walked out the door (I'm guessing to go on break) with a pizza in her hand. We waited for 30 minutes only for the guy to tell me they had lost my pizza. They had absolutely no clue what happened to it, and the girl wasn't there. He offered to make me a new one, but I had to ask for a refund because I didn't have time to wait. I then waited on another guy (who I assume was the manager), who had to process the refund. He gave me back $8 and some chance. I questioned this because I had ordered a mega dough, which is over $9. I was told that my order wasn't even rung up correctly to begin with, when I questioned this and asked the girls name both guys thought this was funny, and laughed and said she was deaf. Why they think that or any of it was funny, I'm not sure. But considering the environment and message MOD tries to send, I didn't find this funny. Facility is nice.

      <td>Good pizza for relatively cheap, but it's nothing to write home about. The pizza crust is a bit thin and almost tastes a bit like cardboard. Fresh ingredients and toppings to choose from and great salad bar. Overall mediocre though.</td>

The squad is always friendly often greeting regulars by name and the pizza always comes out perfectly crispy without charring the edges like some other locations. If you've never been to MOD Pizza, just know that it's a build your own pizza chain where you can add as many or as few toppings as you'd like.</td>

      <td>I came in today and it was a rainy day until there weren't that many people in and I decided to give it a try. I ordered my pizza mini pizza with minimal toppings and I don't know if it was the manager or not but you didn't have a name tag on, she wasn't white lady probably a little older and she was chatting it up with a couple of head of me. I waited my turn in line and when she finally helped me a guy came to relieve her so she went ahead and went on the cashier to check people out. So as you checking me out I asked her about there no name cakes and I said I want one and then she says okay it's charging for it I pay my food and then I go and I sit and I wait for my pizza. Another previous customer that just was before me came back and asked for a couple extra sides and the same lady says oh have you tried our no-name cakes before and the customer said oh I have tried one but I haven't tried the newest one. So she says oh go ahead take one for free and like her a free No Name Pizza when she literally 2 seconds before and made sure that I had the $0.25 that was all my total as I'm rubbing Ginger my purse trying to tell her I have it I just have to dig in for it. When I was checking out she paid me no eye contact and totally was nonchalant but then when she saw the other customers, that was her same race she was over the moon happy and offering free things. Definitely I'm never coming here again horrible customer service and the fact that she charged me for something and then goes and offer it still free to other people I think is bad for business.</td>
